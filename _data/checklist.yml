      description: |
        You want a name that is unique: it shouldn't be already registered in
        your state, the trademark shouldn't be taken for your business, the
        domain name should be available. You should also think about a logo,
        brand identity, business cards, letterhead, etc.

        Most startups should start off as either an LLC or C Corp. If
        you plan on raising money (especially from VCs), issuing shares of 
        stock, or growing into a large company that gets acquired, you'll almost
        certainly want to be a Delaware C Corp. If your plans are more modest,
        at least in the early days, it is cheaper and easier to start off as an
        LLC. Either one protects your personal assets from a lawsuit. Figure out
        distribution of shares. Use eshares.
