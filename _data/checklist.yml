        Answer two questions. The first question is, "Can this problem be
        solved?" This is a question of market realities. Do the technologies
        exist? Is there a market? Is it economically feasible? Or, as Sequoia likes to ask,
        "<a href="http://pando.com/2013/02/20/sequoias-why-now/" target="_blank">Why now?</a>"
        The second question is, "Can this problem be solved by <em>you</em>?
        This is a question of both your personal assets (skills, money,
        connections) and passions. Building a successful company takes on the
        order of 10 years, so make sure this is an idea you want to work on for

          description: |
            If you've got the money for it, you can fund the business out of
            your own savings. This works best for businesses that have low
            up-front costs and can start making money early in their lives,
            such as a service business that can start charging clients
            immediately.
        - name: "Loans"
          description: |
            Raise money by promising to pay it back in the future, usually with
            interest. The advantage of a loan versus equity financing is that you
            keep control over your business. The disadvantage of a loan is that
            you eventually have to pay it back, usually with interest, whether
            or not your company is successful. If you're very confident your
            business will be making enough money by the time the loan payments
            are due, a loan can be great, but for many startups, equity
            financing is a better option.
        - name: "Equity financing"
          description: |
            Raise money from investors in exchange for a part of the company.
            The advantage of equity financing is that you can raise very large
            amounts of money, which is important for businesses that have large
            up-front costs (e.g., SpaceX) or cannot be monetized for a long time
            (e.g., Facebok). The disadvantage of equity financing is that to
            raise more money, you have to give up control of more of your
            company. If you give up too much control, you may find the company
            moving in a direction you don't like (e.g., the investors force you
            to go public because they want to see a return on their investment)
            or you may even get fired from your own business. See

            amount of money from a large number of people online. There are
            three primary types of crowdfunding platforms: rewards-based, where
            you offer rewards or the actual product in exchange for the money (e.g.,

            debt-based, where you eventually pay the money back, similar to a

            The magic number is a metric that represents the moment your users
            have an "aha" experience with your product&mdash;that is, they
            finally get the value and become highly engaged users. For Facebook,
            it was connecting with 7 friends in the first 10 days; for Twitter,
            it was 30 follows; for DropBox, it was 1 file upload (see
            <a href="http://www.growhack.com/2012/12/04/discovering-your-aha-moment/">here</a>
            for more). Find the magic number for your business, and suddenly,
            decision making and priotization across the company becomes much
            easier, as everyone can rally behind a single, simple concept.

        Culture is not a soft, squishy topic that you can ignore. It is the very

            then, do so carefully, revisit often, and prefer automation to
