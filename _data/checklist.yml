        Answer two questions. The first question is, "Can this problem be 
        solved?" This is a question of market realities. Do the technologies 
        exist? Is there a market? Is it economically feasible? Or, as Sequoia likes to ask,
        "<a href="http://pando.com/2013/02/20/sequoias-why-now/" target="_blank">Why now?</a>"
        The second question is, "Can this problem be solved by <em>you</em>? 
        This is a question of both your personal assets (skills, money, 
        connections) and passions. Building a successful company takes on the 
        order of 10 years, so make sure this is an idea you want to work on for 
        a decade.

        Are you sure you want to build a startup to solve this problem? Perhaps
        you could solve it better by creating a lifestyle business? Or by

        Remember,

        do in terms of trademarks, copyrights, and patents? What are all of 
        these conditions on the term sheet? The best way to answer these 
        questions is to hire a lawyer who is experienced with helping startups.

        Every company needs to track its income, expenses, assets, liabilities,

        system for your business. For small companies, a tool like 
        <a href="http://quickbooks.intuit.com/" target="_blank">Quickbooks</a>
        is usually your best bet. Use it to track all purchases, keep track of
        all receipts, send invoices to customers, track services you're paying 
        for, and to set up payroll. Make sure you learn and comply with all 
        government requirements around payroll taxes, self-employment taxes,

        designed to convince investors that they should give you money. It will
        include a brief overview of your business plan, but instead of a formal
        and stuffy document, it should tell a story, engage the viewer 
        emotionally, show off the team you've built, and make it clear what 
        you're looking for. For more information, see

      sublist:
        - name: "Bootstrap"
          description: |
            If you've got the money for it, you can fund the business out of 
            your own savings. This works best for businesses that have low
            up-front costs and can start making money very early in their lives, 
            such as a service business that can start charging clients 
            immediately.
        - name: "Loans"
          description: |
            Raise money by promising to pay it back in the future, usually with 
            interest. The advantage of a loan versus equity financing is that you 
            keep control over your business. The disadvantage of a loan is that
            you eventually have to pay it back, usually with interest, whether
            or not your company is successful. If you're very confident your 
            business will be making enough money by the time the loan payments 
            are due, a loan can be great, but for many startups, equity-based 
            fundraising is a better option.
        - name: "Equity financing"
          description: |
            Raise money from investors in exchange for a part of the company.
            The advantage of equity financing is that you can raise very large
            amounts of money, which is important for business that have large
            up-front costs (e.g., SpaceX) or cannot be monetized for a long time
            (e.g., Facebok). The disadvantage of equity financing is that to
            raise more money, you have to give up control of more of your 
            company. If you give up too much control, you may find the company
            moving in a direction you don't like (e.g., the investors force you
            to go public because they want to see a return on their investment)
            or you may even get fired from your own business. See

        - name: "Crowdfunding"
          description: |
            Instead of raising a large amount money from a small number of 
            investors, you can use crowdfunding platforms to raise a small 
            amount of money from a large number of people online. There are
            three primary types of crowdfunding platforms: rewards-based, where
            you offer rewards or the actual product in exchange for the money (e.g.,
            <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/" target="_blank">KickStarter</a>,
            <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/" target="_blank">IndieGoGo</a>);
            debt-based, where you eventually pay the money back, similar to a 
            loan (e.g., 
            <a href="https://www.lendingclub.com/" target="_blank">Lending Club</a>,
            <a href="https://www.prosper.com/" target="_blank">Prosper</a>);
            and equity-based, where you give investors part-ownership of your
            company in exchange for the money (e.g., 
            <a href="https://www.crowdfunder.com/" target="_blank">Crowdfunder</a>,
