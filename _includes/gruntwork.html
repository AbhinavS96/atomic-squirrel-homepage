    In 2015, I launched Atomic Squirrel to try to make it easier to build a startup. Along the way, I met Josh Padnick,
    who was trying to solve the same problem at his company, Phoenix DevOps. Our companies began working together and
    after many months and many happy clients, Iâ€™m happy to announce that we are now officially joining forces at a
    single new company called <a href="{{ gruntwork_url }}">Gruntwork</a>!
