  <h2>The Startup Checklist</h2>
  <p>
    This is a list of everything you need to do to launch a startup. At Atomic
    Squirrel, we believe in the
    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Checklist-Manifesto-Things-Right/dp/0312430000" target="_blank">power of the humble checklist</a>,
    and after using this one for years to successfully launch a variety of
    projects, we're excited to share it with all of you. Every time you launch
    something new, consult this list to make sure you didn't forget any
    important steps. Did you set up Google Analytics? Is your website showing
    up in search results? Are you tracking business expenses correctly? Did you
    set up social media accounts and a mailing list? Is your database backed up
    regularly?
  <p>
    Please note that this list is always a work in progress. It covers
    the most common tasks you'd need to do at just about every startup, but the
    startup world is constantly changing, and every startup is a little
    different, so some things may not apply to your startup and some things that
    your startup needs may be missing. The list is open source, so we welcome
    any corrections, updates, and additions on
    <a href="{{ site.website_repo_url }}">GitHub</a>. Also, the list doesn't go
    into much detail on each task, so for a deeper look, check out the book
    <a href="http://www.hello-startup.net/?ref=startup-checklist-intro">Hello, Startup: A Programmer's Guide to Building Products, Technologies, and Teams.</a>
  </p>

    We hope you find this list useful for launching your startup. As you fill
    out the checklist, your progress will automatically be saved in your
    browser. You can also print the checklist at any time. If you need help with
    any of the items, or just need feedback and advice, you can submit your
    list to Atomic Squirrel at the
    <a href="#submit-list" data-scroll>bottom of the page</a>, and we'll set up
    a <strong>free 30 minute call</strong> to discuss your startup.
